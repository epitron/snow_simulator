# 3D Snow-o-Matic

## Concept

This is a snow simulator that I wrote for my Computer Graphics course at [Queen's](http://queensu.ca). It lets you simulate snow falling on a 3D model, complete with piles and little avalanches. (Note: The avalanche algorithm isn't physically accurate -- I had to make it an approximation so that it could run in realtime)

What's it written in? Why, C++ and OpenGL, of course; it even comes with source!

__I hope you like SNOW!__
